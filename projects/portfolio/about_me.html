            <p id="paragraph">My name is Jhanvi Lotwala. I am a student at San Jose State University. My major is Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. I declared my major in Applied Math because I liked math since high school. Later on I became interested in Computer programming as well. I have learned back-end languages like Java and C and I have started learning python recently. I want to explore in the field of data science as it is the booming industry right now. </p>
            <p id="paragraph">I am also interested in learning about front-end languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript which is useful in web designing which is why currently I am taking a class in Web Designing. Web designing and web development seems interesting and easier than building an application in Java. I intend to pursue a career in the software industry. I always think that coding and math is a great combination because it complels the mind to think out of the box. The tools I use in coding are eclipse IDE, github, and Visual Studio Code.</p>
