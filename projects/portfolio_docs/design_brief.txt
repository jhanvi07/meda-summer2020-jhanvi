Portfolio Design:
I would use black as background color of the website and text in the body, header, link, and footer would be in white color. I want to make the website simple because it is a portfolio which should look professional. I will add my portrait photo which looks professional. For my tech skills, I would add icons of the tools I use generally which are VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Eclipse and few more. As I am doing web designing currently, I will add an image related to that.

ABOUT ME: 
My name is Jhanvi Lotwala. I am a student at San Jose State University. My major is Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. I declared my major in Applied Math because I liked math since high school. Later on I became interested in Computer programming as well. I have learned back-end languages like Java and C and I have started learning python recently.

I am also interested in learning about front-end languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript which is useful in web designing which is why currently I am taking a class in Web Designing. I intend to pursue a career in the software industry. I always think that coding and math is a great combination because it complels the mind to think out of the box.
