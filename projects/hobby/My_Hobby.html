        <h1>My Hobby Page</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Jhanvi Lotwala. I study Applied Mathematics at San Jose State University in California, USA. I am going to share my most favorite hobby with you today. I like cooking very much. I mostly cook Indian food in my free time at home. I have recently developed this hobby because I have been staying at home for a while due to the pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Learning my hobby</h2>
        <p>I have been watching different recipes online on youtube to learn cooking. I look out for the one that is easy to make and which requires less ingredients as I am a beginner. I try to find the food that is good for health such as fruit smoothies. I am strictly vegetarian so that is one thing I always take care of while searching for the recipes. My mom cooks Indian food everyday at home so I decided why not give it a try at cooking. I am going to share 3 of my most recent recipes here.</p>

        <h3>White sauce pasta Indian-style:</h3>

        <h3>Chocolate cake:</h3>
        <img src="homemade_cake.jpg" alt="chocolate cake" width="200" height="200"/><p>&#169;Jhanvi</p>
        <p>I baked this cake from the Betty Crocker cake-mix. I bought the cake-mix from a nearby grocery store and the recipe was given on the box. I changed only one thing which was instead of eggs, I used 3/4th cup of plain yogurt. <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/products/betty-crocker-baking-and-cake-mixes/devils-food">Here</a> is the link to the Betty Crocker's cake mix website where you can find more information.</p><br>
